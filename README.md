# Drug-Testing
I will be comparing four drug treatments to see how they fare as a potential drug treatment to squamous cell carcinoma, which is a common form of skin cancer.
I will be looking at data from a recent animal study on mice who were treated with each drug over the course of 45 days.
For this project I will be using Pandas and Matplotlib to help with the statistical breakdown and visualizations.
